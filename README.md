# Amazon-Smart-Home-Data-Scrape
Program: This program is written to scrape Amazon's website using each item's unique 'data-asin identifier' to recreate a shortened working url to each item which can be iterated through by simply swapping out the data-asin value at the end of each url. The program then extracts the data values from each item's page, then writes each value to a row in a .csv file named 'scraped_data.csv' under the appropriate # column header.

A visual example(ScreenShot) of the ASIN(s) within the page source code is

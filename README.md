# Amazon-Smart-Home-Data-Scrape
# Program: This program is written to scrape Amazon's website # using each item's unique 'data-asin identifier' to recreate # a shortened working url to each item which can be iterated # through by simply swapping out the data-asin value at the # end of each url. The program then extracts the data values # from each item's page, then writes each value to a row in a # .csv file named 'scraped_data.csv' under the appropriate # column header.
